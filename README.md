# Inappropriate-Content-Detection

This is a README file for a project that utilizes YOLOv5 for detecting inappropriate content in images. The project aims to provide a solution for automatically identifying and flagging images that contain explicit or inappropriate content.

## Features
- Inappropriate content detection: The system uses YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to identify explicit or inappropriate content in images.
- Customizable thresholds: You can adjust the confidence threshold for detection to control the sensitivity of the system.
- Batch processing: The system supports batch processing, allowing you to analyze multiple images simultaneously.
- Integration-friendly: The output of the detection system can be easily integrated into other applications or systems for further processing or action.

## Technologies Used
- YOLOv5: A deep learning-based object detection algorithm.
- PyTorch: An open-source machine learning framework used for training and running deep neural networks.
- Python: The programming language used to implement the detection system.
- OpenCV: A computer vision library used for image processing and manipulation.
- Flask: A Python web framework used to create a simple API for interacting with the detection system.
